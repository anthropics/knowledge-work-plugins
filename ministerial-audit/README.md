# Ministerial Audit Plugin

A "strategic equalizer" for Ministers and Ministerial Advisors, providing them with the tools to audit, verify, and challenge work produced by departmental officials. It bridges the information asymmetry between the bureaucracy and the executive.

## Core Capabilities

- **Audit & Redline**: Detect "officialese," jargon, and passive voice that masks risk or shifts intent.
- **Slow-Walk Detection**: Identify implementation plans designed for delay (excessive committees/consultation).
- **Strategic Synthesis**: Generate "Option 4" policy alternatives and map political risks.
- **Wargaming**: Prepare for Cabinet or media forums by simulating hostile questioning.
- **Comms Translator**: Distill complex briefs into 30-word "Doorstops" and strategic talking points.

## Commands

- `/audit`: Audit a departmental briefing or bill for obfuscation and alignment.
- `/brief`: Generate a "Counter-Brief" with strategic alternatives and risk radars.
- `/prep-meeting`: Wargame a proposal and prepare for Cabinet/Committee pushback.

## Skills

- `bureaucracy-redliner`: The core auditing lens.
- `strategic-synthesis`: Generating alternatives and accountability mechanisms.
- `wargaming`: Simulating colleague personas and lobbyist x-rays.
- `comms-translator`: Translating audits into public narratives.

## Jurisdictional Focus

Defaults to **AU/NZ** standards (Cabinet Manual, constitutional norms) with explicit **US/EU-Lite** portability modes.
