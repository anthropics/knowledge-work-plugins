name: ministerial-audit/strategic-synthesis
description: This skill enables Ministers and Advisors to move beyond simple auditing to generating strategic alternatives and identifying systemic risks. Use it to generate "Option 4" policy alternatives, map political risks across stakeholders, identify gaps in consultation, and suggest accountability mechanisms like sunset clauses.

# Strategic Synthesis (The Executive Brain)

This skill provides the strategic "counter-weight" to departmental policy framing. It assists the Executive in identifying what has been omitted, who has been ignored, and how to structure policy for long-term political success and accountability.

**Important**: This skill is for strategic planning and decision support. It does not replace the need for formal department-led policy development but provides the Minister with a high-leverage "Shadow Policy" capability.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke when:
- A briefing presents "Options" that feel restricted or biased toward a departmental preference.
- You need to map the political impact of a policy across different societal and industry groups.
- Auditing the "Consultation" section of a brief for missing or marginalized voices.
- Designing a new program and wanting to build in automatic exit or review mechanisms.
- Developing a "Shadow Brief" to challenge a departmental narrative in Cabinet.

## Regulatory Context

| Jurisdiction | Synthesis Goal | Accountability Norm | Success Indicator |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **AU/NZ (Baseline)** | Ministerial Responsibility | Public Interest Test | PBAC/MSAC-style evidence rigor |
| **United States (Lite)** | Executive Privilege | OMB Circular A-4 | RIA (Regulatory Impact Analysis) |
| **United Kingdom (Lite)** | Political Neutrality | The Green Book | Value for Money (VfM) |

### AU/NZ Specifics
- **Ministerial Responsibility**: Ministers are responsible for the policy direction, regardless of departmental advice.
- **Evidence-Based Policy**: Ensuring the "evidence" isn't just internal departmental recycling.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Moving beyond the "usual suspects" to find broader community impact.

## Quick Reference

1.  **Generate Option 4**: Identify the omitted ideological alternative to the departmental choices.
2.  **Map Risk Radar**: Use the "Political Risk Radar" to predict stakeholder reactions.
3.  **Audit Consultation**: Identify which groups were *not* consulted and why it matters.
4.  **Recommend Accountability**: Build in "Sunset Clauses" and mandatory independent reviews.
5.  **Stress Test Logic**: Find the "Edge Case" scenarios where the policy fails.

## Detailed Guidance

### 1. The "Option 4" Generator
Departments often present three choices: Suicidal, Ineffectual, and "The Department's Pick."
- **Analyze the Logic**: Identify the constraints the department has placed on the problem.
- **Break the Frame**: Suggest a fourth option that aligns with the Minister's core ideological goals (e.g., more market-led, more community-focused, or more disruptive to the status quo).
- **Evaluate Feasibility**: Provide a "rough order of magnitude" for implementation of Option 4.

### 2. Political Risk Radar
Map the policy across the political landscape:
- **Direct Winners/Losers**: Who gains/loses money, power, or convenience immediately?
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: How do groups like Unions, Chambers of Commerce, or Advocacy groups react?
- **"The Front Page" Test**: Predict the headline in a hostile vs. friendly media outlet.
- **Alignment Check**: Does this conflict with the party's core voting base or swing-voter commitments?

### 3. Consultation Auditor
Identify the "silent voices" in a departmental brief:
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: List who was consulted.
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing sectors (e.g., small business vs. corporate; rural vs. urban; end-users vs. providers).
- **Power Imbalance**: Flag if the "Consensus" is dominated by groups that benefit from the status quo.

### 4. Sunset & Review Recommender
Ensure the Minister has an "exit strategy":
- **Sunset Clauses**: Recommend automatic expiration (e.g., 5 years) for new regulatory powers.
- **Independent Reviews**: Mandate a review by a non-departmental entity (e.g., Auditor General, Private Consultant) at the 24-month mark.
- **Success Metrics**: Define what "Failure" looks like *before* implementation begins.

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] **Option 4 Brief**: A credible alternative proposal with its own risks and benefits.
- [ ] **Stakeholder Matrix**: Mapping "Support vs. Influence" for the proposed policy.
- [ ] **Consultation Gap Report**: List of missing perspectives and proposed "Targeted Consultation" questions.
- [ ] **Accountability Framework**: Proposed Sunset and Review clauses for the legislation.

## Common Mistakes (Anti-Patterns)

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Instead |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Confusing "Policy Risk" with "Political Risk" | Departments focus on "will the program work?"; Ministers care about "will I get blamed?". | Explicitly separate the two in your synthesis. |
| Relying on Departmental "Preferred" options | These are often designed for administrative ease, not political effectiveness. | Always demand an alternative that prioritizes the Minister's mandate. |
| Assuming "Consultation" means "Agreement" | Often it's just informing people. | Check for evidence of *changed* thinking based on consultation feedback. |
| Making Sunset clauses too long | A 10-year sunset is a lifetime in politics; it rarely triggers change. | Suggest 3-5 years for high-risk or novel programs. |

## Confidence Indicators

| Scenario | Confidence | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Omitted option is clearly viable and aligns with manifesto | High | Present as a priority "Option 4." |
| "Consultation" section is missing key critical stakeholders | High | Flag as a major procedural risk. |
| Complex multi-stakeholder reaction predicted | Medium | Suggest a "Wargaming" session to refine responses. |

## Standard and Lite Modes

- **Standard**: Full Option 4 generation, Stakeholder Mapping, and Accountability design.
- **Lite**: Rapid "Consultation Gap" check and high-level "Risk Radar" summary.

## Tool Requirements

- `~~web-search` - For international precedents and stakeholder sentiment.
- `~~ministerial-audit/bureaucracy-redliner` - (Prerequisite) To identify the gaps to be synthesized.

## Success Indicators

You've applied this skill well when:
- [ ] The Minister chooses a more effective option that the department hadn't proposed.
- [ ] A "blind spot" in stakeholder consultation is addressed before a media scandal breaks.
- [ ] A program has clear "Success/Failure" triggers built in from day one.
- [ ] The Minister is prepared for the "Political Risk" that the departmental brief ignored.
