description: "Evaluate candidates against role requirements using structured rubrics and scorecards. Provides consistent, evidence-based assessments with bias mitigation. Trigger with \"evaluate this candidate\", \"score this resume\", \"compare candidates\", \"how does this person stack up\", \"is this a fit\", or when the user shares a resume, candidate profile, or interview feedback and asks for an assessment."

# Candidate Evaluation

Structured framework for evaluating candidates consistently across any role. Works standalone with pasted resumes and job descriptions; supercharged when connected to an ATS with scorecards and historical data.

## How It Works

- **Standalone**: Paste a resume, LinkedIn summary, or interview notes along with the role requirements. Get a structured evaluation with dimension-by-dimension scoring.
- **With connectors**: Pull candidate data from the ATS, reference the team's rubrics from the knowledge base, and compare against historical hiring decisions.

## Evaluation Framework

### Dimension Categories

Every candidate evaluation maps to these six dimensions. Weight and specific criteria vary by role.

| Dimension | What to assess | Common signals |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Technical/functional skills** | Can they do the core work? | Past projects, tools, certifications, portfolio |
| **Domain experience** | Do they know this space? | Industry tenure, relevant companies, market knowledge |
| **Scope and impact** | Have they operated at this level? | Team size led, revenue owned, project complexity |
| **Growth trajectory** | Are they on an upward arc? | Promotion velocity, increasing responsibility, learning signals |
| **Collaboration and communication** | Can they work with the team? | Cross-functional projects, stakeholder management, writing samples |
| **Motivation and alignment** | Will they thrive here? | Career goals, values fit, reason for exploring |

### Scoring Scale

| Score | Label | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 4 | Strong hire | Exceeds the bar — clear evidence across multiple signals |
| 3 | Hire | Meets the bar — sufficient evidence with minor gaps |
| 2 | No hire | Below the bar — significant gaps or insufficient evidence |
| 1 | Strong no hire | Clear misalignment — fundamental gaps or red flags |

### Bias Mitigation Checklist

Apply before finalizing any evaluation:

- Am I evaluating evidence or making assumptions about potential?
- Am I holding all candidates to the same criteria, regardless of background?
- Am I conflating "culture fit" with "similar to people already here"?
- Am I penalizing non-traditional career paths that demonstrate the same competencies?
- Am I over-indexing on pedigree (school, company names) vs. actual accomplishments?
- Would I rate this evidence the same if it came from a different demographic?

## Comparative Evaluation

When comparing multiple candidates for the same role:

1. Score each candidate independently first — never adjust scores after comparing
2. Create a comparison matrix with all dimensions side by side
3. Identify where candidates differentiate (often only 1-2 dimensions matter)
4. Consider team composition — what does the existing team need?
5. Document the reasoning, not just the scores

## Output Format

When evaluating a candidate, produce:

1. **Overall recommendation** with confidence level
2. **Dimension scores** with evidence for each
3. **Key strengths** — top 2-3 with specific proof points
4. **Key risks** — top 2-3 with mitigation strategies or questions to resolve
5. **Comparison** to other candidates if applicable

## Connectors

| Connector | Enhancement |
|-----------|------------|
| ATS | Pull application history, prior feedback, source attribution |
| Data enrichment | Current title verification, company details, tenure accuracy |
| Knowledge base | Team rubrics, competency frameworks, hiring manager preferences |
