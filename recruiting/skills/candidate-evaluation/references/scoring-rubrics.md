# Scoring Rubrics by Function

Detailed rubric definitions for the six evaluation dimensions, tailored by function. Use these as starting points and customize for specific roles.

## Engineering Roles

### Technical Skills

| Score | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| 4 - Strong hire | Has deep expertise in the core tech stack. Built systems at comparable scale. Can articulate trade-offs and has opinions grounded in experience. Portfolio/contributions demonstrate mastery. |
| 3 - Hire | Solid proficiency in the core stack. Has worked at relevant scale with some guidance. Can learn adjacent technologies quickly. Good problem-solving instincts. |
| 2 - No hire | Surface-level familiarity with the stack. Hasn't worked at the required scale. Struggles to articulate technical decisions or trade-offs. Significant ramp time expected. |
| 1 - Strong no hire | Fundamental gaps in core skills. Misrepresents experience level. Unable to engage in technical discussion at the expected depth. |

### System Design / Architecture

| Score | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| 4 - Strong hire | Designs for scale, maintainability, and operational concerns unprompted. Considers failure modes. Has built similar systems. Articulates clear reasoning for decisions. |
| 3 - Hire | Produces reasonable designs with appropriate prompting. Considers major trade-offs. May need guidance on edge cases or operational concerns. |
| 2 - No hire | Designs are naive or over-engineered. Misses critical requirements. Doesn't consider scale or failure modes. Needs significant guidance. |
| 1 - Strong no hire | Cannot produce a coherent design. Fundamental misunderstanding of system design principles. |

### Scope and Impact

| Score | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| 4 - Strong hire | Has owned projects/systems end-to-end with measurable business impact. Led technical strategy for a team or domain. Clear evidence of multiplying others' effectiveness. |
| 3 - Hire | Has completed significant projects independently. Contributed to team strategy. Beginning to mentor others and influence beyond their immediate work. |
| 2 - No hire | Mostly executed defined tasks. Limited evidence of independent project ownership. Scope doesn't match the level we're hiring for. |
| 1 - Strong no hire | Only evidence of task execution with close supervision. Scope is significantly below the target level. |

## Product Roles

### Customer Insight

| 4 - Strong hire | Deep empathy for users backed by rigorous research methods. Can articulate user needs that users themselves haven't expressed. Has shipped features that meaningfully moved user metrics. |
| 3 - Hire | Good instinct for user needs. Uses data and research to validate hypotheses. Has examples of user-informed product decisions. |
| 2 - No hire | Relies on assumptions about users. Limited evidence of research-informed decisions. May conflate personal preferences with user needs. |
| 1 - Strong no hire | Disconnected from user reality. Makes product decisions without user input. No evidence of user research or data-driven thinking. |

### Prioritization

| Score | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| 4 - Strong hire | Frameworks-driven prioritization with clear evidence of impact. Can say no convincingly. Balances short-term delivery with long-term strategy. Manages stakeholder expectations masterfully. |
| 3 - Hire | Uses reasonable frameworks to prioritize. Can articulate trade-offs. Generally makes sound bets. May struggle with the most ambiguous situations. |
| 2 - No hire | Prioritizes by recency or loudest voice. Struggles to articulate why one thing matters more than another. Evidence of scope creep or inability to focus. |
| 1 - Strong no hire | No visible prioritization framework. Reactive to requests. Cannot demonstrate making a hard trade-off. |

## Leadership Roles (Any Function)

### People Leadership

| 4 - Strong hire | Built and developed high-performing teams. Team members have grown significantly under their leadership. Can articulate their management philosophy with specific examples. |
| 3 - Hire | Has managed people effectively. Some evidence of developing others. Generally positive team outcomes. Growing as a leader. |
| 2 - No hire | Limited management experience or mixed results. May rely on authority rather than influence. Team outcomes are unclear or concerning. |
| 1 - Strong no hire | Evidence of poor people management. High team turnover without good explanation. Unable to articulate how they develop others. |

### Strategic Thinking

| Score | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| 4 - Strong hire | Sets direction that others follow. Anticipates market shifts. Has made strategic bets that paid off. Thinks in systems, not just features. |
| 3 - Hire | Contributes meaningfully to strategy. Can connect daily work to broader goals. Shows evidence of forward-looking thinking. |
