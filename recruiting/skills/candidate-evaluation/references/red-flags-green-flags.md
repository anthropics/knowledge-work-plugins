# Red Flags and Green Flags in Candidate Evaluation

Patterns to watch for when evaluating candidates. These are signals, not verdicts — always seek additional evidence before making a decision based on a single flag.

## Green Flags (Positive Signals)

### Career Trajectory
- **Increasing scope over time** — each role has more responsibility, larger teams, bigger problems
- **Promoted from within** — especially if promoted quickly, signals strong performance
- **Sought out for hard problems** — moved to new teams/projects specifically to fix or build something
- **Startup-to-scale experience** — has seen a company grow through multiple stages
- **Boomerang employee** — left and came back to a former employer (they know what they're getting)

### Interview Behavior
- **Specific examples with metrics** — "I increased retention by 15% by..." vs. "I improved retention"
- **Acknowledges failures and learnings** — "Here's what went wrong and what I'd do differently"
- **Asks thoughtful questions about the role** — shows they're evaluating fit, not just selling
- **Credits their team** — "We built..." not "I built..." (while still showing their contribution)
- **Demonstrates curiosity** — asks follow-up questions, wants to understand the problem deeply
- **Comfortable saying "I don't know"** — followed by how they'd figure it out

### References and Reputation
- **Former colleagues want to work with them again** — the ultimate signal
- **Referenced without prompting** — others mention them as a strong collaborator
- **Their previous team members follow them** — people who've worked with them seek them out

## Red Flags (Concerning Signals)

### Career Pattern Flags
- **Consistent short tenure** (<18 months repeatedly) — may indicate performance issues, poor judgment, or inability to commit. BUT: normalize for industry (startups have shorter tenure) and early career (first 2-3 roles often shorter)
- **Lateral moves without growth** — moving companies at the same level repeatedly without progression
- **Unexplained gaps** — not that gaps are bad, but evasiveness about them is a flag. Many gaps have great explanations (caregiving, health, travel, education)
- **Title inflation without scope** — "VP" at a 5-person company doesn't equal "VP" at a 5,000-person company

### Interview Behavior Flags
- **Vague about contributions** — can't articulate what they specifically did vs. what the team did
- **Blames others consistently** — every failure was someone else's fault
- **Can't explain decisions** — "That's just how we did it" without understanding why
- **Oversells and doesn't listen** — treats the interview as a pitch rather than a conversation
- **Different story to different interviewers** — inconsistencies across the interview loop
- **Can't go deep on claimed expertise** — surface-level answers on skills listed as "expert"
- **Negative about every past employer** — one bad experience is normal; a pattern is concerning

### Reference Check Flags
- **Can't provide peers or reports as references** — only offers managers or friends
- **References are carefully scripted** — feel rehearsed, lack specifics
- **"They'd be great in the right role"** — polite way of saying not a strong performer
- **Hesitation before positive statements** — the pause often says more than the words

## Flags That Are Not Actually Flags

Be careful not to penalize candidates for:

- **Non-traditional backgrounds** — bootcamps, self-taught, career changers may have exactly the skills you need
- **Career gaps** — parenting, health, caregiving, education, travel are all legitimate
- **Accent or communication style** — assess communication effectiveness, not conformity to one style
- **Lack of "name brand" employers** — great talent exists at every company size
- **Being quiet or introverted** — don't confuse confidence with competence
- **Over-qualification** — understand their motivation rather than assuming they'll be bored
- **Job-hopping in the first 5 years of career** — early-career exploration is normal and healthy
