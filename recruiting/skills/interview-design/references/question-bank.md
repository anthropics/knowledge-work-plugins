# Interview Question Bank

Structured questions organized by competency. Each question includes the competency assessed, follow-up probes, and what to listen for. Customize for specific roles and levels.

## Behavioral Questions (STAR Format)

### Problem Solving and Technical Judgment

**Q: Tell me about a time you had to make a technical decision with incomplete information. What was the situation, and how did you approach it?**
- Follow-up: What information did you wish you had? How did you mitigate the risk of being wrong?
- Strong signal: Structured approach to ambiguity, considered reversibility, gathered what data they could, made a call and monitored results
- Weak signal: Waited for perfect information, made a gut call without reasoning, doesn't acknowledge the uncertainty

**Q: Describe a project where you had to significantly change your approach mid-stream. What triggered the change and how did you handle it?**
- Follow-up: How did you communicate the change to stakeholders? What would you do differently?
- Strong signal: Recognized signals early, adapted without ego, communicated proactively, salvaged what they could
- Weak signal: Blamed external factors, didn't learn from the experience, rigid thinking

**Q: Walk me through the most complex system/project/campaign you've worked on. What made it complex, and how did you manage that complexity?**
- Follow-up: What would you simplify if you could do it again? Where did complexity bite you?
- Strong signal: Can articulate what made it complex (not just "it was big"), has a framework for managing complexity, identifies unnecessary complexity
- Weak signal: Equates size with complexity, no framework, seems overwhelmed recounting it

### Collaboration and Communication

**Q: Tell me about a time you disagreed with a colleague or manager on an important decision. How did you handle it?**
- Follow-up: What was the outcome? Would you approach it differently now?
- Strong signal: Raised disagreement constructively, supported data over opinion, committed to the decision once made (even if they disagreed), maintained the relationship
- Weak signal: Avoided the conflict, escalated without trying to resolve, held a grudge, "I was right and they were wrong"

**Q: Describe a time you had to influence someone without authority. What was your approach?**
- Follow-up: What was at stake? How did you read the other person's priorities?
- Strong signal: Understood the other person's motivations, framed their case in terms of shared goals, was persistent but respectful
- Weak signal: Used pressure, went around them, gave up quickly, doesn't distinguish influence from authority

**Q: Tell me about a time you received tough feedback. How did you respond?**
- Follow-up: What changed as a result? How do you typically seek feedback?
- Strong signal: Listened without defensiveness, took concrete action, sought more feedback after, can describe what they learned
- Weak signal: Dismisses the feedback, blames the messenger, no evidence of change, hasn't received feedback (unlikely — more likely they don't recall or can't be vulnerable)

### Leadership and Ownership

**Q: Tell me about a time you took ownership of something outside your formal responsibilities. Why, and what happened?**
- Follow-up: How did others respond? Did it create any friction?
- Strong signal: Saw a gap and filled it proactively, navigated ambiguity about ownership, created value, handled any political dynamics maturely
- Weak signal: Can't think of an example, only does what's assigned, waited to be asked

**Q: Describe a situation where you had to get a group of people aligned around a direction they weren't initially bought into.**
- Follow-up: What resistance did you encounter? How did you handle dissenters?
- Strong signal: Understood individual concerns, built buy-in incrementally, used data and narrative, allowed space for dissent while moving forward
- Weak signal: Used authority, ignored concerns, achieved compliance not alignment

**Q: Tell me about a time you made a mistake that had real consequences. What happened and what did you do?**
- Follow-up: How did you prevent it from happening again? What did you learn?
- Strong signal: Takes full ownership, describes the impact honestly, took action to fix and prevent, shares the learning willingly
- Weak signal: Minimizes the mistake, blames circumstances, no evidence of change, struggles to recall any mistakes (low self-awareness)

### Growth and Learning

**Q: What's something you've deliberately gotten better at in the last year? How did you approach improving?**
- Follow-up: How do you know you've improved? What's next on your development list?
- Strong signal: Specific skill, deliberate practice, can measure progress, shows self-awareness about gaps
- Weak signal: Vague ("I'm always learning"), can't point to specific improvement, no method

**Q: Describe a time you had to learn something quickly to be effective in your role. How did you ramp up?**
- Follow-up: How long did it take? What resources did you use? How did you know you were ready?
- Strong signal: Structured approach to learning, leveraged multiple resources, asked for help, applied knowledge quickly
- Weak signal: Passive learning, took too long, didn't ask for help, can't describe their method

## Situational Questions

**Q: Imagine you're starting this role and in your first week you discover that [specific scenario relevant to the role]. How would you approach it?**

**Q: You have three priorities, all due this week, and your manager adds a fourth. How do you handle it?**

**Q: A teammate consistently delivers late, impacting your work. Your manager hasn't noticed. What do you do?**

**Q: You've proposed a solution that the team disagrees with, but you believe strongly it's the right approach. What's your next move?**
