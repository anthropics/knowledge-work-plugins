# Interview Format Guide

Different interview formats and when to use each one. Choose formats based on what you're assessing, the role level, and practical constraints.

## Format Comparison

| Format | Best for | Duration | Assesses | Candidate experience |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Behavioral** | All roles | 30-60 min | Past behavior, judgment, values | Comfortable (familiar format) |
| **Technical deep-dive** | Engineering, data, technical roles | 45-90 min | Technical depth, problem-solving | Can be stressful — set expectations |
| **Case study** | Product, strategy, consulting roles | 45-60 min | Analytical thinking, frameworks | Engaging if well-designed |
| **Live coding** | Engineering (IC) | 45-60 min | Coding ability, communication | High variance — standardize carefully |
| **Take-home project** | Engineering, design | 2-4 hours | Quality of work, process | Respectful of time if well-scoped |
| **Portfolio review** | Design, marketing, content | 45-60 min | Craft quality, decision-making | Natural and conversational |
| **Panel interview** | All roles (senior+) | 45-60 min | Multiple perspectives at once | Can be intimidating — keep panel small |
| **Working session** | All roles | 60-90 min | Collaboration, real-world skills | Highly authentic, shows working style |
| **Reverse interview** | Senior+ candidates | 30 min | Candidate's judgment and priorities | Candidates appreciate this |

## Format Deep Dives

### Behavioral Interview

**Structure:**
1. Opening and rapport (5 min)
2. Behavioral questions (35-45 min, 3-5 questions)
3. Candidate questions (10 min)
4. Close and next steps (5 min)

**Tips:**
- Use the STAR follow-up pattern: Situation → Task → Action → Result
- If the candidate is vague, probe: "What specifically did *you* do?"
- Listen for "we" vs. "I" — both are fine, but understand their specific contribution
- Allow silence — don't rush to fill it

### Technical Deep-Dive

**Structure:**
1. Context setting (5 min) — "We're going to explore [topic]. I'll start with some foundational questions and go deeper."
2. Breadth questions (15 min) — Assess range of knowledge
3. Depth questions (25-35 min) — Drill into areas of claimed expertise
4. Architecture/design (15-20 min) — Apply knowledge to a realistic problem
5. Candidate questions (5-10 min)

**Tips:**
- Start broad and narrow based on their answers — let the candidate lead you to their strengths
- "I don't know" is a valid answer — follow up with "how would you find out?"
- Don't assess memorization — assess understanding and reasoning
- Give partial credit generously; assess the approach, not just the answer

### Take-Home Project

**Design principles:**
- **Time-boxed**: Clearly state "this should take 2-4 hours" and mean it
- **Realistic**: Based on actual work they'd do in the role
- **Open-ended enough**: Multiple valid approaches, room for creativity
- **Paid**: If longer than 2 hours, compensate the candidate's time
- **Clear evaluation criteria**: Share them upfront so candidates know what matters

**What to evaluate:**
- Code quality and readability (not cleverness)
- Approach and architecture decisions
- Testing and edge case handling
- Documentation and communication
- How they handle ambiguity in the spec

**Follow-up session (30-45 min):**
- Walk through their solution
- Ask about trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Discuss how they'd extend or scale it
- Probe decisions that seem unusual

### Working Session

**Structure:**
1. Frame the problem (10 min) — share a real (anonymized) challenge the team is facing
2. Collaborative work (40-60 min) — work on it together, as if they were already on the team
3. Debrief (10-15 min) — discuss the experience, what they'd do with more time

**Why it works:**
- Shows how they think and collaborate in real-time
- Reduces performance anxiety — feels like work, not a test
- Gives the candidate a realistic preview of the job
- Hard to fake — you see their actual working style

**Tips:**
- Choose a problem that's genuinely unsolved (they might teach you something)
- Participate as a peer, not an evaluator — make it collaborative
- Note how they ask clarifying questions, handle disagreement, and iterate

## Scheduling Considerations

### Full Loop Timeline

| Role level | Total interview time | Stages | Typical timeline |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Junior/Mid | 3-4 hours | 3-4 stages | 1-2 weeks |
| Senior | 4-5 hours | 4-5 stages | 2-3 weeks |
| Staff/Lead | 5-6 hours | 5-6 stages | 2-4 weeks |
| Director+ | 6-8 hours | 5-7 stages | 3-5 weeks |

### Reducing Candidate Burden

- Combine stages into a half-day or full-day onsite when possible
- Virtual interviews: max 4 hours in a day with breaks
- Don't repeat questions across stages — coordinate the panel
- Respect that candidates have day jobs — offer flexible scheduling
- Move fast — every extra day in the process is a chance to lose the candidate
