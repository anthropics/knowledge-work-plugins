# Inclusive Language Guide for Recruiting

Specific language substitutions and patterns for writing inclusive job descriptions, outreach messages, and candidate communications.

## Gendered Language Replacements

| Instead of | Use | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Rockstar, ninja, guru | Expert, specialist, skilled professional | Coded masculine, can feel exclusionary |
| Aggressive | Ambitious, driven, tenacious | Research links "aggressive" to masculine stereotypes |
| Competitive | Results-oriented, high-performing | Can discourage collaborative candidates |
| Dominant | Leading, influential, authoritative | Aggressive connotation |
| Manpower | Workforce, staffing, team capacity | Gendered term |
| Chairman | Chair, chairperson | Gendered term |
| Guys | Team, folks, everyone, y'all | Gendered when addressing groups |
| He/she | They (singular) | More inclusive of all gender identities |
| Man-hours | Person-hours, work hours | Gendered term |

## Exclusionary Requirement Patterns

### Degree Requirements

| Instead of | Use | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| "Bachelor's degree required" | "Bachelor's degree or equivalent experience" | Opens the door to self-taught and alternative education |
| "CS degree from a top university" | "Strong computer science fundamentals" | Screens on knowledge, not pedigree |
| "MBA preferred" | "Experience in [specific business skill]" | Names the actual skill needed |

### Experience Requirements

| Instead of | Use | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| "10+ years of experience" | "Deep expertise in [skill], demonstrated through complex projects" | Years ≠ expertise; penalizes career changers |
| "5+ years in Python" | "Proficient in Python with production experience" | Tests skill, not time |
| "Native English speaker" | "Strong written and verbal communication skills" | Legal risk, excludes bilingual talent |
| "Digital native" | "Comfortable with [specific tools/platforms]" | Age-coded language |

### Culture Fit Language

| Instead of | Use | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| "Culture fit" | "Culture add — what new perspective do you bring?" | Fit ≠ sameness; add implies growth |
| "Work hard, play hard" | "We're a team that takes both our work and well-being seriously" | Signals overwork, can exclude parents/caregivers |
| "Fast-paced environment" | "We ship frequently and iterate based on feedback" | Be specific about what "fast" means |
| "Young and dynamic team" | "Our team brings diverse experience and energy" | Age-discriminatory |
| "Recent graduate" | "Early-career professional" | Excludes non-traditional timelines |

## Inclusive Job Description Checklist

- [ ] Does the JD focus on what the person will DO, not who they ARE?
- [ ] Are must-haves truly must-haves (required on day 1)?
- [ ] Is the nice-to-have list short (3 or fewer)?
- [ ] Are there fewer than 10 total requirements?
- [ ] Is a salary range included?
- [ ] Is the inclusion statement specific (not just "we're an equal opportunity employer")?
- [ ] Are physical requirements only listed if genuinely job-related?
- [ ] Is the language free of jargon that insiders would understand but outsiders wouldn't?
- [ ] Would someone from a non-traditional background see themselves in this JD?
- [ ] Is the application process accessible (screen reader compatible, reasonable time expectations)?

## Inclusive Outreach Language

### Opening Lines

**Less inclusive:**
> "I came across your profile and your background is impressive."

**More inclusive:**
> "Your work on [specific project] caught my attention because [specific reason related to the role]."

Why: The first is generic and could trigger imposter syndrome. The second validates specific work.

### Describing the Opportunity

**Less inclusive:**
> "We're looking for a brilliant engineer who can hit the ground running."

**More inclusive:**
> "We're building [specific thing] and looking for someone who's excited about [specific challenge]. You'd have [specific support — mentoring, onboarding, team structure] to ramp up."

Why: "Brilliant" and "hit the ground running" signal that only already-perfect candidates should apply. The second version signals support and growth.

### Closing

**Less inclusive:**
> "Let me know if you're interested. We move fast so the sooner the better."

**More inclusive:**
> "Would you be open to a 20-minute conversation to explore this? Happy to work around your schedule."

Why: Low-pressure, specific ask, respects their time.

## Inclusive Rejection Language

**Template:**
> Thank you for taking the time to interview with us for the [Role] position. After careful consideration, we've decided to move forward with another candidate whose experience more closely aligns with our current needs.
>
> This was a competitive process, and your [specific positive — skills, experience, approach] made a strong impression. We'd welcome the opportunity to stay in touch for future roles that might be a better match.
>
> If you'd find it helpful, I'm happy to share more specific feedback about our decision.

**Key principles:**
- Be timely (within 48 hours of decision)
- Be specific about what was strong (not just "you were great")
- Offer feedback (not everyone wants it, but offer)
- Leave the door open genuinely
- Never ghost — it's the single biggest employer brand killer
