# Diversity Recruiting

Evidence-based practices for building inclusive hiring processes that reach diverse talent pools and evaluate candidates equitably. Not a separate workflow — these principles integrate into every stage of recruiting.

## How It Works

- **Standalone**: Get actionable guidance on making any part of your hiring process more inclusive, from JD writing to offer negotiations.
- **With connectors**: Analyze pipeline diversity metrics from the ATS, audit JDs from the knowledge base, and track representation goals.

## Inclusive Practices by Stage

### 1. Job Description & Requirements

**Common issues and fixes:**

| Problem | Why it matters | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Gendered language ("rockstar", "ninja", "aggressive") | Research shows women are less likely to apply | Use neutral alternatives ("skilled", "driven", "tenacious") |
| Excessive requirements | Women apply when meeting 100% of requirements; men at 60% | Separate must-haves from nice-to-haves, reduce total requirements |
| Unnecessary degree requirements | Excludes self-taught and non-traditional backgrounds | List specific skills needed instead |
| Years of experience requirements | Disadvantages career changers and returners | Describe proficiency level needed, not years |
| "Culture fit" language | Signals homogeneity | Use "culture add" — what new perspective does this person bring? |
| No salary range | Perpetuates pay gaps for candidates with less negotiation leverage | Include the range |

**Language audit checklist:**
- Run the JD through a gender decoder tool (or just search for: aggressive, competitive, dominant, challenging → replace with: collaborative, supportive, analytical, innovative)
- Remove "preferred" qualifications that aren't actually preferred
- Add an explicit inclusion statement that's specific, not generic
- Ensure physical requirements are truly job-related

### 2. Sourcing

**Expand beyond the usual channels:**
- HBCUs, HSIs, and tribal colleges
- Historically underrepresented professional organizations (NSBE, SHPE, AnitaB, /dev/color, Lesbians Who Tech, Out in Tech, Disability:IN)
- Returnship programs and career re-entry networks
- Coding bootcamps and alternative education programs
- Community colleges and vocational programs
- Veteran transition programs
- International talent pools

**Referral program audit:**
- Referrals tend to replicate existing demographics — this isn't malicious, it's network effects
- Supplement referrals with structured outbound sourcing to diverse communities
- Consider bonus incentives specifically for diverse referrals (legal in most jurisdictions — consult your legal team)

### 3. Screening

- Use structured screening criteria defined before reviewing candidates
- Blind resume review where possible (remove names, photos, schools)
- Evaluate accomplishments, not credentials
- Watch for "pattern matching" to existing team members

### 4. Interviewing

- **Structured interviews** are the single most effective bias reducer
- Same questions for every candidate at a given stage
- Pre-defined rubrics with specific behavioral anchors
- Diverse interview panels where possible
- Train interviewers on common biases:
  - **Affinity bias**: Preferring people similar to yourself
  - **Halo/horn effect**: One strong/weak signal coloring the whole evaluation
  - **Confirmation bias**: Seeking evidence to confirm initial impression
  - **Attribution bias**: Attributing success to environment for some, to skill for others

### 5. Offer & Negotiation

- Present the same offer structure to all candidates at the same level
- Don't ask for salary history (illegal in many jurisdictions, perpetuates gaps)
- Have a defined negotiation framework — don't give more to those who negotiate harder
- Be transparent about the comp philosophy and how the offer was built

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | What it measures | How to use it |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Pipeline diversity by stage** | Where diverse candidates drop off | Identify the leaky stage and investigate |
| **Source diversity** | Which channels produce diverse candidates | Invest more in high-diversity channels |
| **Interview pass rate by demographic** | Whether evaluation is equitable | Flag disparities for investigation |
| **Offer rate parity** | Whether offers are extended equitably | Audit decision-making if disparities exist |
| **Acceptance rate parity** | Whether offers are equally attractive | Check comp equity and candidate experience |
| **Hiring manager diversity** | Pattern of who gets hired onto which teams | Coach managers with persistent gaps |

## Output Format

When advising on inclusive hiring, produce:

1. **Assessment of current process** — where bias is most likely to enter
2. **Specific recommendations** — actionable changes, not generic advice
3. **Language suggestions** — concrete rewrites, not just "be more inclusive"
4. **Sourcing channels** — specific communities and organizations relevant to the role
5. **Metrics to track** — what to measure and what to watch for

## Connectors

| Connector | Enhancement |
|-----------|------------|
| ATS | Pipeline diversity analytics, stage-by-stage demographic data |
| Knowledge base | Company DEI commitments, ERG contacts, approved language guidelines |
| Data enrichment | Identify diverse professional communities and organizations |
