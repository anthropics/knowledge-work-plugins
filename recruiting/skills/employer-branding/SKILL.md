# Employer Branding

Framework for crafting authentic, compelling employer brand content that attracts the right candidates. Covers EVP development, job marketing, candidate communications, and experience design.

## How It Works

- **Standalone**: Describe your company, team, or role and get employer brand messaging, recruitment marketing copy, and candidate communication templates.
- **With connectors**: Pull existing brand materials from the knowledge base, analyze competitor positioning via web search, and distribute content through chat and email.

## Employer Value Proposition (EVP) Framework

### EVP Pillars

Every compelling EVP addresses these five dimensions:

| Pillar | Questions to answer | Examples |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Mission and impact** | What problem are we solving? Why does it matter? | "We're making healthcare accessible to 100M people" |
| **Growth and development** | How will people grow here? What will they learn? | "Engineers ship to production in week 1, lead projects by month 3" |
| **People and culture** | Who will they work with? What's the working style? | "Small teams, high autonomy, weekly demo culture" |
| **Compensation and rewards** | How do we invest in our people? | "Top-quartile comp, meaningful equity, unlimited learning budget" |
| **Work environment** | How, when, and where do people work? | "Remote-first, async-heavy, quarterly offsites" |

### EVP Development Process

1. **Audit current messaging** — Careers page, JDs, Glassdoor profile, social media
2. **Identify real differentiators** — What's genuinely different, not just "we have great people"
3. **Talk to recent hires** — Why did they actually join? What surprised them?
4. **Talk to candidates who declined** — Why did they choose elsewhere?
5. **Map to talent segments** — Different audiences value different pillars

### Messaging Principles

- **Specific > Generic**: "We deploy 50 times a day" beats "We move fast"
- **Evidence > Claims**: Show, don't tell — numbers, stories, examples
- **Honest > Aspirational**: Don't sell a culture you don't have
- **Candidate-centric**: Frame everything as "what's in it for you", not "what we need"
- **Differentiated**: If a competitor could say the same thing, it's not a differentiator

## Content Templates

### Job Marketing Copy (Social/LinkedIn)

```
[Hook — specific, interesting detail about the role or team]

We're looking for [role] to [specific impact they'll have].

What makes this different:
→ [Differentiator 1 — specific]
→ [Differentiator 2 — specific]
→ [Differentiator 3 — specific]

[Link] | [Compensation range if applicable]
```

### Recruiter Outreach Hook Library

| Angle | Template | Best for |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Mission** | "We're [specific mission statement]. I'm reaching out because [their background] suggests you care about [related problem]..." | Mission-driven candidates |
| **Technical challenge** | "[Specific technical problem] — your work on [their project] caught my eye because..." | Engineers, technical roles |
| **Growth** | "We're [stage/growth signal] and building [team]. This is a [specific growth opportunity]..." | Career builders |
| **People** | "I work with [notable person/team detail]. We're looking for someone who [specific trait they demonstrate]..." | Culture-motivated candidates |

### Candidate Experience Communications

Key touchpoints that shape employer brand:

| Touchpoint | Timing | Must include |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Application confirmation** | Immediate | Timeline, what to expect, human touch |
| **Status update** | Every 5-7 business days | Where they are, next step, honest timeline |
| **Interview prep** | 48 hours before | Who they'll meet, format, how to prepare |
| **Post-interview** | Within 24 hours | Thank you, timeline for next steps |
| **Rejection** | Within 48 hours of decision | Specific feedback (if possible), warmth, future openings |
| **Offer** | Within 2 days of debrief | Excitement, full package details, decision support |

## Output Format

When creating employer brand content, produce:

1. **Audience analysis** — who we're targeting and what they value
2. **Key messages** — 3-5 specific, differentiated value propositions
3. **Content** — ready-to-use copy for the requested channel/format
4. **Tone guidance** — how the content should feel and what to avoid
5. **Distribution plan** — where and how to share the content

## Connectors

| Connector | Enhancement |
|-----------|------------|
| Knowledge base | Existing brand guidelines, culture docs, benefits information |
| Chat | Distribute content to hiring channels, collect employee testimonials |
| Email | Send candidate communications, nurture campaigns |
| Cloud storage | Access brand assets, photos, templates |
