description: "Define job levels, competency frameworks, and role scoping for recruiting. Helps clarify what a role actually needs versus what's traditionally listed. Trigger with \"what level is this\", \"define this role\", \"competency framework\", \"leveling guide\", \"what should the requirements be\", or when the user discusses role definition, leveling, job families, or career ladders in a hiring context."

# Job Architecture

Framework for defining roles, levels, and competencies in the context of hiring. Ensures job requirements reflect actual needs rather than inflated wish lists, and that leveling is consistent across the organization.

## How It Works

- **Standalone**: Describe a role and get a structured breakdown of level-appropriate scope, competencies, and requirements.
- **With connectors**: Pull existing leveling frameworks from the knowledge base, check HRIS for approved headcount and band, and reference similar roles in the ATS.

## Leveling Framework

### Generic Engineering Levels (adapt to function)

| Level | Title pattern | Scope | Experience signal | Key differentiators |
|-------|--------------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| L3 | Junior/Associate | Defined tasks with guidance | 0-2 years | Learning, executing, asking good questions |
| L4 | Mid-level | Features and projects with direction | 2-5 years | Independent execution, some ambiguity tolerance |
| L5 | Senior | Projects end-to-end, mentors others | 5-8 years | Owns outcomes, influences design, unblocks others |
| L6 | Staff/Lead | Multi-project, cross-team impact | 8-12 years | Sets direction, navigates org complexity, multiplies team |
| L7 | Principal/Director | Org-wide strategy and execution | 12+ years | Defines the roadmap, industry perspective, builds teams |

### Competency Dimensions by Function

**Engineering**: Technical depth, system design, code quality, debugging, architecture, mentorship
**Product**: Customer insight, prioritization, stakeholder management, data fluency, strategy
**Design**: Craft quality, user research, systems thinking, cross-functional collaboration, critique
**Sales**: Pipeline generation, discovery, negotiation, relationship building, forecasting
**Marketing**: Positioning, channel strategy, measurement, creative direction, brand stewardship
**Operations**: Process design, automation, vendor management, compliance, scalability

### Requirements Calibration

When defining role requirements, apply these filters:

1. **Is this truly required on day 1?** If they can learn it in 3 months, it's a nice-to-have
2. **Does this requirement serve the work or the hiring manager's preference?** Remove vanity requirements
3. **Does this artificially narrow the pool?** "10 years of React" excludes excellent engineers who used other frameworks
4. **Can we test this in the interview instead of screening for it?** Skills > credentials
5. **Are we using years of experience as a proxy for something measurable?** Name the actual skill

### Role Scoping Checklist

When scoping a new role:
- What problem does this hire solve? (not "what will they do" but "what changes when they're here")
- What does this person own that nobody currently owns?
- What does success look like at 30/60/90 days?
- What's the minimum viable version of this role?
- Could an internal move or contractor solve this instead?

## Output Format

When defining a role or leveling, produce:

1. **Role summary** — purpose, scope, team context
2. **Level assessment** — where this role sits in the framework and why
3. **Competency profile** — weighted dimensions for this specific role
4. **Requirements** — must-haves vs. nice-to-haves, calibrated against the filters above
5. **Success metrics** — what "great" looks like at 30/60/90 days

## Connectors

| Connector | Enhancement |
|-----------|------------|
| Knowledge base | Pull existing leveling guides, career ladders, and competency frameworks |
| HRIS | Check approved headcount, compensation bands, and org structure |
| ATS | Reference similar roles, past job descriptions, and hiring outcomes |
