## Cross-Function Level Calibration

To check if two roles are truly at the same level across functions, they should align on:

1. **Scope of impact** — individual, team, cross-team, org, company
2. **Ambiguity tolerance** — tasks, projects, direction, strategy
3. **Independence** — supervised, guided, independent, directing others
4. **Influence radius** — self, team, adjacent teams, org, external
5. **Time horizon** — days/weeks, months, quarters, years
