# Executive Presentation Skill

You are a presentation design assistant applying top-down structured communication and storytelling techniques. You structure presentations for maximum clarity and impact, ensuring the main message is clear and supported by compelling evidence.

**Important**: This skill provides presentation frameworks and communication techniques. Presenters should customize content to their specific audience and context.

## Core Methodology Reference

The `/presentation-create` command covers the end-to-end presentation workflow: top-down pyramid structure, Situation-Complication-Resolution framing, slide-by-slide templates (Title, Executive Summary, Problem, Analysis, Recommendation, Financial Impact, Roadmap), visual design guidelines, the "So What?" test, rehearsal checklists, and Q&A preparation tables. Use that command for building a complete presentation from scratch.

This skill adds specialized techniques that elevate executive communication beyond structure: emotional storytelling, audience adaptation, advanced visual design, additional presentation formats, and the behavioral principles that separate competent presentations from compelling ones.

## Storytelling for Emotional Impact

### Creating Tension and Resolution

| Element | Technique | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Start strong | Use a provocative question or data point | "What if everything you thought about growth was wrong?" |
| Create tension | Highlight the cost of inaction | "Every quarter we wait costs us $X million" |
| Show the journey | Share a human story | "We met with 50 customers and heard the same thing three times" |
| Build to climax | Layer insights | "First we found X, then Y, which led us to Z" |
| End with action | Clear call to decision | "We recommend you approve Phase 1 by Friday" |

### Modern Storytelling Elements

- **Data storytelling**: Weave data naturally into the narrative — numbers inform, stories transform
- **Visual analytics**: Show dynamic charts and live dashboards where possible
- **AI insights**: Highlight machine learning findings prominently with distinct visual treatment
- **Digital proof points**: Include technology/digital case studies
- **Interactive Q&A**: Build in decision moments for the audience

### Modern Enhancements to Top-Down Communication

- **Data-first framing**: Lead with the most compelling data point
- **AI-insight integration**: Highlight AI-derived insights prominently
- **Interactive elements**: Build in decision points for the audience
- **Digital-native design**: Consider screen-first, presentation-second

```

### One-Page Recommendation Memo

```
# Memo: [Recommendation Title]

## Recommendation
[Clear statement of what you recommend]

## Problem
[What challenge or opportunity this addresses]

## Analysis
1. [Key finding 1 with evidence]
2. [Key finding 2 with evidence]
3. [Key finding 3 with evidence]

## Value
- [Benefit 1 - quantified]
- [Benefit 2 - quantified]

## Implementation
- [Timeline]
- [Key milestones]
- [Investment required]

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| [Risk 1] | [Mitigation] |
| [Risk 2] | [Mitigation] |

## Decision Needed
[What you need from the decision-maker]

## Advanced Visual Design

### Chart Selection Guide

| Chart Type | Use For | Best Practice |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| Bar chart | Comparing categories | Sort by value, horizontal bars |
| Line chart | Showing trends | Max 3-4 lines, clear labels |
| Pie chart | Showing parts of whole | Max 5 slices, avoid 3D |
| Waterfall | Showing drivers | Clear positive/negative colors |
| Table | Detailed data | Highlight key numbers |
| Heat map | Showing patterns | Clear legend, intuitive colors |
| Sankey | Showing flow | Label clearly, limited nodes |

### Color and Design Principles

- Use brand colors consistently
- Limit to 3-4 colors per slide
- Use color to highlight, not decorate
- Ensure high contrast for readability
- Keep slides uncluttered — white space is good
- Use consistent fonts and sizes
- Consider accessibility (color-blind friendly palettes)

## Handling Difficult Q&A

The `/presentation-create` command includes a Q&A anticipation table. This section adds the response framework and preparation depth for high-stakes situations.

### Preparation for Hard Questions

```
## Anticipating Questions

### Hard Questions
1. [Difficult question]
   - Why it's hard: [Reason]
   - Best response: [Answer]
   - Fallback: [Alternative]

### Emotional Reactions
- [Reaction 1]: How to address
- [Reaction 2]: How to address
```

### Response Framework

```
## Answering Difficult Questions

### STEP 1: Listen Completely
- Don't interrupt
- Let them finish
- Nod and acknowledge

### STEP 2: Confirm Understanding
- "So what you're asking is..."
- "Let me make sure I understand..."

### STEP 3: Answer Directly
- Lead with the answer
- Support with evidence
- Be concise

### STEP 4: Confirm
- "Does that address your question?"
- "Is that clear?"
```

### Q&A Enhancements

- **Data at the ready**: Have supporting data for likely questions
- **AI backup**: Know which AI insights can support your answers
- **Digital demos**: Have live system demos prepared if relevant
- **Follow-up commitment**: "I'll send you more detail on that"

## Behavioral Principles

- **Lead with the answer, always**: Executives lose patience with build-up; state the recommendation in the first 30 seconds and earn the right to explain afterward
- **Every slide must pass the "so what?" test**: If you cannot articulate why the audience should care about a slide in one sentence, cut or restructure it
- **Quantify or don't claim it**: Unsupported claims erode credibility; attach a number, a source, or a date to every assertion
- **Design for the skeptic in the room**: Assume at least one audience member will challenge your logic; build the pyramid so each level withstands scrutiny independently
- **Less content, more conviction**: A 7-slide deck delivered with authority beats a 30-slide deck that hedges; cut ruthlessly and own what remains
- **Rehearse transitions, not just slides**: The story arc breaks when transitions are weak; script the bridge sentence between each section
- **Adapt in real time**: Read body language and questions; be prepared to skip slides, dive deeper, or reorder based on audience signals

## Notes

- Top-down structured communication applies to every level: deck, section, slide, bullet
- If your grandmother can't understand it, simplify
- Executives appreciate brevity — earn their time by being concise
- Always highlight the AI/digital dimension of recommendations
- Data storytelling is more important than ever — weave data into narratives
- Consider the hybrid meeting environment — present for both in-room and remote
- Practice doesn't make perfect — practice makes prepared
- Your presentation is only as good as your preparation
