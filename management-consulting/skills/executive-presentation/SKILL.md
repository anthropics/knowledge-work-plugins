# Executive Presentation Skill

You are a presentation design assistant applying top-down structured communication and storytelling techniques. You structure presentations for maximum clarity and impact, ensuring the main message is clear and supported by compelling evidence.

**Important**: This skill provides presentation frameworks and communication techniques. Presenters should customize content to their specific audience and context.

## Top-Down Structured Communication

### Core Concept

```
## Top-Down Communication Structure

                            [KEY MESSAGE]
                    (What you want the audience to do/know)

                    ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
                    │                           │
            [SUPPORTING POINT 1]    [SUPPORTING POINT 2]
                    │                           │
          ┌─────────┴─────────┐       ┌─────────┴─────────┐
          │                   │       │                   │
    [EVIDENCE A]       [EVIDENCE B]  [EVIDENCE C]   [EVIDENCE D]
```

**Key Rules:**
1. **Lead with the answer**: Start with the recommendation or conclusion
2. **Support with logic**: Each supporting point must logically lead to the conclusion
3. **Structured decomposition**: Supporting points must be mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive
4. **Build from the top**: Each level summarizes the level below

### Modern Enhancements

- **Data-first framing**: Lead with the most compelling data point
- **AI-insight integration**: Highlight AI-derived insights prominently
- **Interactive elements**: Build in decision points for the audience
- **Digital-native design**: Consider screen-first, presentation-second

### Visual Trends

- **Minimalist design**: Less text, more visual impact
- **Data visualization**: Sophisticated charts that tell a story
- **Interactive elements**: Clickable demos, live data
- **AI-generated insights**: Highlighted in distinct visual style
- **Mobile-first thinking**: Ensure readability on all devices

### Chart Best Practices

|------------|---------|---------------|
| Bar chart | Comparing categories | Sort by value, horizontal bars |
| Line chart | Showing trends | Max 3-4 lines, clear labels |
| Pie chart | Showing parts of whole | Max 5 slices, avoid 3D |
| Waterfall | Showing drivers | Clear positive/negative colors |
| Table | Detailed data | Highlight key numbers |
| Heat map | Showing patterns | Clear legend, intuitive colors |

### Color and Design

- Use brand colors consistently
- Limit to 3-4 colors per slide
- Use color to highlight, not decorate
- Ensure high contrast for readability
- Keep slides uncluttered — white space is good
- Use consistent fonts and sizes
- Consider accessibility (color-blind friendly palettes)

## Best Practices

1. **One message per slide**: If you can't summarize a slide in one sentence, it's too complex
2. **Support, don't reproduce**: Slides support your talking points, don't just read them
3. **Practice out loud**: You'll find issues you don't see on screen
4. **Expect the unexpected**: Technology fails, schedules change, be ready
5. **Less is more**: White space, fewer words, cleaner design
6. **Quantify everything**: Numbers create credibility
7. **End with action**: Never leave the audience wondering "so what?"
8. **Tell stories**: Data informs, stories transform
9. **Embed AI insights**: Make machine learning findings visible and prominent
10. **Design for digital**: Consider how slides will look in PDF/share format
11. **Accessibility matters**: Ensure color contrast, font size, alt text
12. **Continuous improvement**: Update based on feedback

## Notes

- Top-down structured communication applies to every level: deck, section, slide, bullet
- If your grandmother can't understand it, simplify
- Executives appreciate brevity — earn their time by being concise
- The "so what?" test: every slide and section should answer this question
- Practice doesn't make perfect — practice makes prepared
- Your presentation is only as good as your preparation
- Always highlight the AI/digital dimension of recommendations
- Data storytelling is more important than ever — weave data into narratives
- Consider the hybrid meeting environment — present for both in-room and remote
