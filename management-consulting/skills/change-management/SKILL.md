## Change Management Best Practices

1. **Start with why**: Clear purpose drives adoption

3. **Change is personal**: Address individual impacts
4. **Communicate, communicate, communicate**: Over-communicate
5. **Measure what matters**: Track leading and lagging indicators
6. **Address resistance early**: Don't let it fester
7. **Celebrate wins**: Recognize progress
8. **Plan for setbacks**: Not everything goes smoothly
9. **Embed in operations**: Don't let change be "extra" work
10. **Build change capability**: Develop internal change leaders
11. **Consider digital channels**: Use technology to enable change
12. **Address AI/anxiety proactively**: Be transparent about AI impact
13. **Hybrid change**: Consider remote/hybrid workforce dynamics

## Notes

- Change management is a discipline, not an afterthought
- Every change is a people change first, then a process/technology change
- Resistance is natural - plan for it
- Sponsorship must be visible and consistent
- Communication is necessary but not sufficient
- Training is necessary but not sufficient
- You can't change people - you can only create conditions for them to change
- Digital transformation and AI adoption require specific change approaches
- Always connect change to purpose and values
