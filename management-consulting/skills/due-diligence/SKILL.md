## Context Adaptation

Adapt DD approach based on deal context:
- **M&A**: Include synergy assessment, integration complexity, valuation adjustments
- **PE Investment**: Include value creation levers, exit scenarios, management incentive alignment
- **Strategic Partnership**: Focus on capability complementarity, cultural fit, governance model
- **Vendor Assessment**: Focus on operational reliability, financial stability, contractual protections
- **Internal Assessment**: Replace M&A terminology with transformation/improvement language, focus on capability gaps and improvement priorities

---

## Notes

- Due diligence findings should always be verified through proper fact-finding
- Focus on material risks first — prioritize deal-killers over minor issues
- Triangulate data from multiple sources to validate findings
- Customer concentration and revenue quality are often the most critical areas
- Document all assumptions and limitations clearly
- Red flags require immediate escalation, not just documentation
- Operational DD often reveals more value creation opportunities than financial DD
- Integration planning should start during DD, not after close
- Always assess the quality of management alongside the quality of the business
- Technology DD is critical for SaaS/digital businesses — don't skip it
- Management assessment often predicts post-deal success better than financial analysis
