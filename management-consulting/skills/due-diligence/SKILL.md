## Notes

- Due diligence findings should always be verified through proper fact-finding
- Focus on material risks first — prioritize deal-killers over minor issues
- Triangulate data from multiple sources to validate findings
- Customer concentration and revenue quality are often the most critical areas
- Document all assumptions and limitations clearly
- Red flags require immediate escalation, not just documentation
- Operational DD often reveals more value creation opportunities than financial DD
- Integration planning should start during DD, not after close
- Always assess the quality of management alongside the quality of the business
