## The Consulting Problem-Solving Process

### Step 1: Define the Problem

Before any analysis, rigorously define the problem. Modern problem definition emphasizes **outcome clarity** and **constraints upfront**:

```
## Problem Definition

### The Question
[What exactly are we trying to solve? State in one sentence.]

### The Context
- Industry: [Industry context and dynamics]
- Organization: [Company context and strategic position]
- Timeframe: [When does this need to be resolved]
- Technology landscape: [Digital/AI context if relevant]

### Success Criteria
- What does a successful solution look like?
- How will we measure success?
- What are the constraints?
- What is the decision timeline?

### Out of Scope
- What are we NOT solving for?
- What boundaries exist?

### Problem Framing Techniques
- **Jobs-to-be-Done**: What job is the client hiring this solution to do?
- **Pain-Priority Matrix**: Rate pain points by frequency × impact
- **Is/Is Not**: Clarify what the problem is and isn't
```

**Key questions to clarify:**
- Is this the right problem to solve?
- Is the problem statement specific enough?
- Are we solving symptoms or root causes?
- What would happen if we did nothing?
- How does digital transformation/AI opportunity change the problem space?
- What data and analytics capabilities exist to support the analysis?

### Step 2: Structure the Problem

Apply the structured decomposition principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive), enhanced with **hypothesis-first structuring**:

```
## Problem Structure (structured decomposition)

### Primary Branches
1. [First dimension of the problem]
   - [Sub-component A]
   - [Sub-component B]
   - [Sub-component C]

2. [Second dimension of the problem]
   - [Sub-component A]
   - [Sub-component B]

3. [Third dimension of the problem]
   - [Sub-component A]
   - [Sub-component B]
   - [Sub-component C]

### Digital/Technology Lens (if applicable)
- What technology-enabled solutions exist?
- What data/analytics can inform this problem?
- What AI/automation opportunities exist?
```

**Common Problem Structures:**

| Problem Type | Recommended Structure | Modern Twist |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Profitability decline | Revenue × Price + Cost structure | Include digital monetization channels |
| Market entry | Market size × Share + Requirements | Add platform/network effects analysis |
| Operational inefficiency | Throughput × Yield + Cycle time | Include automation/AI potential |
| Customer churn | Acquisition × Retention × Lifetime value | Add personalization/AI-driven retention |
| Growth strategy | Core business + Adjacent opportunities + Transformational | Include platform/ecosystem plays |
| Digital transformation | Current state + Capability gaps + Technology options | Add AI maturity and adoption factors |

### Step 3: Prioritize Issues

Modern prioritization uses **value-effort analysis** combined with **hypothesis importance**:

```
## Issue Prioritization

| Issue Branch | Importance | Feasibility of Analysis | Value Potential | Priority |
|--------------|------------|------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| [Issue 1] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | 1 |
| [Issue 2] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | 2 |
| [Issue 3] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | 3 |

### Priority Rationale
- [Why Priority 1 matters most]
- [What we need to learn]
- [Quick wins we can pursue in parallel]
```

**Decision criteria enhancements:**
- Where is the biggest lever?
- Where is the data available?
- What will have the greatest impact?
- What is the time sensitivity?
- Where can AI/analytics accelerate insight?
- What can we test quickly with minimum viable analysis?

### Step 4: Develop Hypotheses

Form testable hypotheses early — this focuses fact-finding. Modern approach emphasizes **specificity** and **actionability**:

```
## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: [Specific, testable statement]
- **Current belief**: [What we think is true]
- **Evidence needed**: [What would prove/disprove]
- **Data source**: [Where to find evidence]
- **Quick test**: [Fast way to validate/invalidate]
- **If true, then**: [Recommended action]

### Hypothesis 2: [Specific, testable statement]
- **Current belief**: [What we think is true]
- **Evidence needed**: [What would prove/disprove]
- **Data source**: [Where to find evidence]
- **Quick test**: [Fast way to validate/invalidate]
- **If true, then**: [Recommended action]

### Hypothesis 3: [Specific, testable statement]
- **Current belief**: [What we think is true]
- **Evidence needed**: [What would prove/disprove]
- **Data source**: [Where to find evidence]
- **Quick test**: [Fast way to validate/invalidate]
- **If true, then**: [Recommended action]
```

**Good hypothesis characteristics:**
- Specific and concrete
- Testable with available data
- Implies a recommended action
- States "we believe X because Y"
- Includes digital/AI dimension when relevant
- Has a quick validation path

### Step 5: Conduct Analysis

Structure your analysis to test hypotheses. Modern analysis leverages **AI and analytics** where possible:

```
## Analysis Plan

### Analysis 1: [Name]
- **Tests hypothesis**: [Which hypothesis]
- **Approach**: [Analytical method]
- **Data required**: [Inputs needed]
- **Expected output**: [What we learn]
- **AI/Analytics opportunity**: [Where can technology accelerate?]

### Analysis 2: [Name]
- **Tests hypothesis**: [Which hypothesis]
- **Approach**: [Analytical method]
- **Data required**: [Inputs needed]
- **Expected output**: [What we learn]
- **AI/Analytics opportunity**: [Where can technology accelerate?]
```

**Analytical approaches:**

| Situation | Recommended Analysis | Modern Addition |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Profit driver identification | Bridge analysis, variance analysis | Real-time dashboard integration |
| Market sizing | Top-down, bottom-up, triangulated | AI-powered market sensing |
| Competitive assessment | Relative positioning, scenario analysis | Competitive AI/intelligence tools |
| Financial projections | Scenario modeling, sensitivity analysis | Monte Carlo + AI forecasting |
| Process optimization | Time studies, root cause analysis | Process mining + AI automation |
| Customer insights | Segmentation, journey mapping | AI-driven sentiment + behavior prediction |

### Step 6: Synthesize Findings

Draw conclusions that answer the original question. Modern synthesis emphasizes **storytelling with data**:

```
## Synthesis

### What We Learned
1. [Finding 1 — directly tests a hypothesis]
2. [Finding 2 — directly tests a hypothesis]
3. [Finding 3 — connects findings]

### So What?
- [Implication of finding 1]
- [Implication of finding 2]
- [Implication of finding 3]

### The Answer
[Direct answer to the problem question]

### Data Visualization Recommendations
- [Key chart type for finding 1]
- [Key chart type for finding 2]
```

### Step 7: Develop Recommendations

Translate findings into action. Modern recommendations include **implementation and AI adoption roadmap**:

```
## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: [Clear action]
- **Rationale**: [Why this addresses the problem]
- **Impact**: [Expected outcome - quantified]
- **Effort**: [Resources required]
- **Timing**: [When to act]
- **Implementation approach**: [How to execute]
- **AI/Technology component**: [Technology-enabled aspects if any]

### Recommendation 2: [Clear action]

## Common Pitfalls

### To Avoid

| Pitfall | Why It's Problematic | Solution |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| Defining the problem too broadly | Diffuses analysis | Narrow scope iteratively |
| Jumping to solutions | Misses root causes | Follow the process |
| Collecting all data | Wastes time | Prioritize hypotheses |
| Confirming existing beliefs | Biases analysis | Actively seek disconfirming evidence |
| Presenting findings without recommendations | Leaves client without action | Always translate to action |
| Ignoring digital/AI dimensions | Misses transformation opportunities | Include technology lens in every problem |
| Over-complicating the analysis | Delays insights | Apply 80/20 principle |
| Not using AI/analytics where available | Misses efficiency | Identify AI augmentation opportunities early |
