```

### Managing Discussion

```
## Discussion Techniques

### For Generating Ideas
- Brainstorming: No criticism, build on others
- Round-robin: Everyone speaks
- Silent writing: Individual first, then share
- Fishbowl: Inner circle discussion, outer observes
- Digital whiteboards for anonymous contribution

### For Making Decisions
- Thumbs up/mid/down: Quick sentiment
- Dot voting: Prioritize options
- Weighted voting: Rank by importance
- Roman room: Pros/cons side-by-side
- Live polling for instant results

### For Virtual/Hybrid
- Use chat for quiet contributors
- Breakout rooms for small group work
- Digital sticky notes for async input
- Recorded sessions for later reference
- Analytics-generated summaries
```

### Handling Difficult Situations

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Dominant participant | "Let's hear from others" or direct question to quiet participant |
| Off-topic discussion | "Park" it for later, return to focus |
| Conflict between participants | Acknowledge both views, find common ground |
| No consensus | Take decision offline, vote, or escalate |
| Low energy | Take a break, change activity, get moving |
| Unprepared participants | Simplify, extend time, adjust expectations |
| **Zoom fatigue** | Shorter segments, more breaks, interactive elements |
| **Virtual disengagement** | Polls, chat questions, breakout activities |

## Workshop Enhancements

### Analytics-Enabled Facilitation

| Phase | AI Application |
|-------|-----------------|
| Pre-workshop | Generate participant briefs, analyze pre-survey data |
| During workshop | Real-time transcription, sentiment analysis, synthesis |
| Post-workshop | Generate summary, action items, follow-up content |

### Hybrid Best Practices

- Test all technology before workshop
- Have dedicated tech support person
- Ensure remote participants have equal voice
- Use visual documentation more heavily
- Build in more breaks for virtual
- Record for asynchronous participants
- Create digital "water cooler" spaces

### Digital Collaboration Tools

- **Miro/Mural**: Visual collaboration
- **Menti/Polling**: Real-time polls
- **Synthesis tools**: Analytics-powered synthesis
- **Notion/Confluence**: Documentation
- **Zoom/Teams**: Video conferencing
- **Slido**: Q&A and polling

---

## Best Practices

1. **Over-prepare**: Every minute of workshop needs 30-60 minutes of preparation
2. **Know your participants**: Adapt content and language to audience
3. **Build in breaks**: Energy drops after 90 minutes without break
4. **Have a backup**: Activities fail, participants are late, technology breaks
5. **Capture everything**: Assign note-taker, photograph flip charts
6. **End on time**: Respect participants' schedules
7. **Follow up quickly**: Send notes within 24 hours, confirm actions
8. **Debrief the team**: What worked, what didn't, what to change
9. **Embrace hybrid**: Design for both in-person and virtual participation
10. **Leverage AI**: Use AI tools to enhance facilitation and follow-up

---

## Notes

- Workshop design is iterative — refine based on participant feedback
- The best workshops feel effortless but are heavily rehearsed
- Always have a plan B for key activities
- Energy and engagement are the facilitator's responsibility
- Don't let perfect be the enemy of good — imperfect action beats perfect inaction
- The most important part of any workshop is what happens AFTER
- Always consider hybrid/virtual participation from the start
- AI tools can significantly enhance pre-work, facilitation, and follow-up
