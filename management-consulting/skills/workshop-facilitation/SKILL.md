## Workshop Enhancements

### Analytics-Enabled Facilitation

| Phase | AI Application |
|-------|-----------------|
| Pre-workshop | Generate participant briefs, analyze pre-survey data |
| During workshop | Real-time transcription, sentiment analysis, synthesis |
| Post-workshop | Generate summary, action items, follow-up content |

### Hybrid Best Practices

- Test all technology before workshop
- Have dedicated tech support person
- Ensure remote participants have equal voice
- Use visual documentation more heavily
- Build in more breaks for virtual
- Record for asynchronous participants
- Create digital "water cooler" spaces

### Digital Collaboration Tools

- **Miro/Mural**: Visual collaboration
- **Menti/Polling**: Real-time polls
- **Synthesis tools**: Analytics-powered synthesis
- **Notion/Confluence**: Documentation
- **Zoom/Teams**: Video conferencing
- **Slido**: Q&A and polling

## Behavioral Principles

- **Energy management is facilitation**: Monitor group energy; switch formats, take breaks, or introduce movement when energy dips
- **Silence is productive**: Allow 10-15 seconds of silence after questions; resist the urge to fill every pause
- **Design for introverts first**: Silent writing before group sharing ensures all voices are captured, not just the loudest
- **The real workshop happens after**: Outcomes without follow-through are theater; prioritize actionable commitments over polished deliverables
