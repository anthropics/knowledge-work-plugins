## Best Practices

1. **Select frameworks intentionally**: Choose based on the question, not habit
2. **Customize frameworks**: Adapt to specific context — generic analysis has limited value
3. **Combine frameworks**: Different frameworks reveal different insights
4. **Fill in with data**: Frameworks are empty without facts
5. **Draw implications**: Analysis without recommendations is incomplete
6. **Challenge assumptions**: Test whether framework conclusions hold
7. **Communicate clearly**: Translate framework output into client language
8. **Include digital dimension**: Always consider technology/AI implications
9. **Apply platform thinking**: Consider network effects and ecosystem dynamics
10. **Think about AI readiness**: Every framework should consider AI implications

---

## Notes

- Frameworks are tools to structure thinking, not formulas to fill in
- The quality of analysis depends on the quality of data and insight, not framework selection
- Always connect framework outputs to actionable recommendations
- Be prepared to explain why certain frameworks were selected or excluded
- When frameworks conflict, explore the contradiction — it often reveals insight
- Digital and AI considerations should be embedded in every framework
- Platform economics and network effects are increasingly important
- ESG factors are now material to strategic analysis
