Create a compelling consulting proposal that wins engagements. Structures the proposal around client needs, differentiators, and proven methodologies.

## Invocation

```
/proposal-develop [client name] [engagement type]
```

If parameters are not provided, ask the user for:
- Client name and background
- Engagement type (strategy, transformation, implementation, due diligence, etc.)
- Scope and objectives

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Client Context

Gather or confirm:

1. **Client background**
   - Industry and market position
   - Recent news or strategic initiatives
   - Current challenges and opportunities

2. **Engagement scope**
   - Problem statement
   - Desired outcomes
   - Scope boundaries
   - Timeline expectations

3. **Decision process**
   - Who decides?
   - Timeline for decision
   - Evaluation criteria (if known)

### Step 2: Structure the Proposal

A winning consulting proposal follows this client-focused structure — lead with their challenges, not your credentials:

```
## 1. Executive Summary
[1 page max: Standalone cover letter that leads with outcomes]

## 2. Understanding Your Challenges
[Context setting - demonstrate client knowledge, use their language]

## 3. Our Recommended Approach
[Methodology and work plan — framed as solution to their specific challenges]

## 4. What This Delivers
[Quantified outcomes, ROI, impact — tie directly to their stated priorities]

## 5. Why [Our Firm]
[Differentiation and relevant experience — credibility to deliver]

## 6. Team
[Key team members and credentials]

## 7. Client References
[Relevant case studies with quantified results]

## 8. Investment
[Pricing and commercial terms]

## 9. Next Steps
[Clear call to action]
```

### Step 3: Develop Each Section

#### Executive Summary (1 page)

Write this LAST but position it FIRST. It must lead with client outcomes, not firm credentials:

```
## Executive Summary

[Client Name] seeks to [their stated objective]. Based on our understanding of your challenges, we propose [solution approach] that will deliver [specific quantified outcome].

**The Outcome You'll Achieve**
- [Primary outcome with metric]

**Our Approach**
We will [high-level methodology] over [timeline], structured in [number] phases, delivering [key deliverables].

**Investment**
[Range or structure with value emphasis]

**Next Steps**
[One clear, low-friction action — e.g., "A 30-minute call to align on scope"]
```

#### Understanding Your Challenges

Demonstrate client knowledge:

- Reference specific challenges they face
- Use their terminology and priorities
- Acknowledge constraints and context

#### Our Approach

Present methodology clearly:

```

**Objective**: [What we achieve]

**Key Activities**:

- [Activity 2]

**Deliverables**:

```

#### Why [Our Firm]

```
## Why [Our Firm]

### Deep Expertise in [Client Industry]
- [Relevant statistic or experience]

### Proven Methodology
- [Methodology differentiator]

### Relevant Client Results
- [Case study 1]: [Result]
- [Case study 2]: [Result]
```

#### Team

Present key team members:

```
## Proposed Team

### [Partner Name], Partner
[Role on engagement]
[Relevant experience - 2-3 bullets]
[Notable credentials]

### [Manager Name], Engagement Manager
[Role on engagement]
[Relevant experience - 2-3 bullets]

[Optional: Org chart or full team matrix]
```

#### Client References

Include relevant case studies:

```
## Relevant Client Experience

### [Client 1] — [Industry]
**Challenge**: [What they faced]
**Approach**: [What we did]
**Results**: [Quantified outcomes]

### [Client 2] — [Industry]
[Same structure]
```

#### Commercial Terms

Present pricing professionally:

```
## Investment

Our proposed fee is [structure]:

| Phase | Fee | Timing |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Phase 1 | $XX | [Date] |
| Phase 2 | $XX | [Date] |
| Total | $XX | |

**Includes**:
- [Included item 1]
- [Included item 2]

**Excludes**:
- [Excluded item 1 - if applicable]

**Assumptions**:
- [Assumption 1]
- [Assumption 2]
```

### Step 4: Differentiate and Persuade

Throughout the proposal, weave in client-focused storytelling and evidence:

- **Lead with outcomes**: Start each section with what this delivers for them
- **Specificity**: Use client names, data, and quantified results — no generic claims
- **Evidence-based credibility**: Case studies with measurable impact, not just credentials
- **Clear differentiation**: Why YOU — specific, not generic "best consultants"
- **Tie to their priorities**: Every section connects back to their stated objectives
- **Low-friction next steps**: One clear action, not a menu of options

## Output Format

Generate a complete proposal document with all sections. Include:

1. **Cover page** (title, client, date, confidentiality notice)
2. **Executive summary** (1 page standalone)
3. **Full proposal** (as structured above)
4. **Appendix** (optional: detailed methodology, team bios, case studies)

After generating, ask:

> "Would you like me to:
> - Adjust the tone or emphasis?
> - Add specific case studies or credentials?
> - Develop the commercial terms in more detail?
> - Create a presentation deck version for oral delivery?"

## Notes

- Keep executive summary to ONE page — it may be the only thing read
- Use the client's language and priorities throughout
- Quantify results wherever possible
- Make the "why us" section memorable and specific
- Include clear, low-friction next steps
- If working from RFP analysis, carry forward the win themes
