# /org-design -- Organizational Design and Restructuring

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Design optimal organizational structures aligned with strategy. Supports organizational transformation, restructuring, and capability building initiatives.

## Invocation

```
/org-design [organization context and redesign objectives]
```

If no context is provided, ask the user to describe the organization and redesign objectives.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess Strategic Requirements

Define what the organization must do to execute its strategy:

```
## Strategic Requirements Analysis

### Strategic Pillars
| Strategic Priority | Key Capabilities Required | Critical Success Factors |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| [Pillar 1] | [Capability] | [Factor] |
| [Pillar 2] | [Capability] | [Factor] |
| [Pillar 3] | [Capability] | [Factor] |

### Digital Strategy Alignment
