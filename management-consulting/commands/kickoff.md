# /kickoff -- Project Kickoff

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Design and execute a project kickoff that establishes clear expectations, governance, and working arrangements. Creates the project charter and sets the engagement up for success.

## Invocation

```
/kickoff [project name] [client]
```

If parameters are not provided, ask for:
- Project/engagement name
- Client organization
- Key stakeholders
- Engagement scope and objectives

## Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Kickoff Materials

Before the kickoff meeting, prepare and share with participants in advance:

1. **Agenda** — Detailed meeting plan shared 24-48 hours ahead
2. **Project Charter Template** — To be completed collaboratively
3. **Stakeholder Map** — Who is involved and their interests
4. **Working Arrangements** — How you'll work together
5. **Expectations Document** — Explicitly outline your expectations of the client
6. **Initial Communication Plan** — How you'll stay aligned

### Step 2: Design the Kickoff Agenda

A comprehensive kickoff follows this structure:

```
## Kickoff Agenda

### Part 1: Introduction (15 min)
- Welcome and introductions
- Project purpose and background
- Meeting objectives

### Part 2: Project Scope (30 min)
- Problem statement
- Scope boundaries
- Success criteria
- Key constraints

### Part 3: Approach & Plan (30 min)
- Proposed methodology
- Phase structure
- Key milestones
- Timeline overview

### Part 4: Governance (20 min)
- Team roles
- Governance structure
- Meeting cadence
- Escalation paths

### Part 5: Working Arrangements (15 min)
- Communication protocols
- Document sharing
- Working styles
- Access requirements

### Part 6: Next Steps (10 min)
- Action items
- Next meetings
- Open questions
```

### Step 3: Develop Project Charter

Complete the project charter during kickoff:

```
# Project Charter: [Project Name]

## 1. Project Overview

### Background
[Brief context on why this project exists]

### Problem Statement
[What problem are we solving?]

### Objectives
| Objective | Success Metric |
|-----------|----------------|
| [Objective 1] | [How we measure success] |
| [Objective 2] | [How we measure success] |
| [Objective 3] | [How we measure success] |

## 2. Scope

### In Scope
- [Deliverable/activity 1]
- [Deliverable/activity 2]

### Out of Scope
- [Explicit exclusion 1]
- [Explicit exclusion 2]

## 3. Timeline

| Milestone | Target Date |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Kickoff] | [Date] |
| [Discovery complete] | [Date] |
| [Analysis complete] | [Date] |
| [Recommendations] | [Date] |
| [Final delivery] | [Date] |

## 4. Governance

### Core Team

| Role | Name | Organization |
|------|------|--------------|
| Project Sponsor | [Name] | [Client] |
| Project Lead | [Name] | [Client] |
| Engagement Manager | [Name] | [Firm] |

| [Name] | [Role] | Strategic decisions |

### Meeting Cadence

| Meeting | Frequency | Attendees |

| Project Team | Weekly | Core team |
| Status Update | Bi-weekly | Extended team |

## 5. Risks & Dependencies

### Key Risks

| [Risk 1] | [H/M/L] | [Mitigation] |
| [Risk 2] | [H/M/L] | [Mitigation] |

### Dependencies

## 6. Communication Plan

| Audience | What | How | When |
|----------|------|-----|------|

## 7. Sign-Off

| Role | Name | Date |
|------|------|------|
| Client Sponsor | | |
| Firm Partner | | |
| Engagement Manager | | |
```

### Step 4: Facilitate Kickoff Meeting

Run the kickoff session following modern engagement best practices:

1. **Set the tone** — Professional, collaborative, outcome-focused
2. **Align on problem** — Ensure shared understanding of the challenge before jumping to solutions
3. **Confirm scope boundaries** — Get explicit agreement on in-scope and out-of-scope
4. **Exchange expectations** — Articulate what you need from the client (access, decisions, resources) and what they can expect from you
5. **Establish governance** — Clear roles, decision rights, and escalation paths
6. **Build relationships** — Personal connections drive engagement success
7. **Address risks early** — Identify potential blockers before they become issues

### Step 5: Document Working Arrangements

Capture operational details:

```
## Working Arrangements

### Communication
- **Primary**: [Email/Slack/Teams]
- **Response time**: [X hours]
- **Status updates**: [Bi-weekly/Monthly]

### Document Sharing
- **Platform**: [SharePoint/Box/Google Drive]
- **Folder structure**: [Link]
- **Version control**: [Convention]

### Meetings
- **Time zone**: [TZ]
- **Recording**: [Yes/No]
- **Notes**: [Who takes]

### Access Required
- [System 1]
- [System 2]
- [Data access]
```

## Output Format

Generate:

1. **Kickoff Agenda** — Detailed meeting plan
2. **Project Charter** — Completed with client input
3. **Stakeholder Map** — Visual or table
4. **Working Arrangements** — Operations document
5. **Communication Plan** — Who gets what, when

After generating, ask:

> "Would you like me to:
> - Adjust the charter for different stakeholder levels?
> - Create a more detailed governance structure?
> - Develop RACI matrix for specific workstreams?
> - Set up recurring meeting invites?"

## Notes

- Kickoff is about ALIGNMENT, not information dump — focus on shared understanding
- Get buy-in on problem statement before proceeding to solutions
- Confirm YOUR expectations explicitly: access, decision-making timelines, client team availability
- Ensure all decision-makers are present or represented
- Document assumptions explicitly — verbal assumptions become scope disputes
- Set realistic expectations on timeline and scope upfront
- Establish "ground rules" for working together early
- Schedule next meeting before closing kickoff
- Share agenda 24-48 hours in advance for participant preparation
