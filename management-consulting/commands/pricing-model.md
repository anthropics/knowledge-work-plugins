## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess Engagement Characteristics

Understand the engagement to determine optimal pricing:

```
## Engagement Assessment

### Project Characteristics
| Factor | Assessment | Pricing Implication |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Scope clarity | [Defined/Fuzzy/Evolving] | Fixed fee if clear |
| Duration | [Short/Medium/Long] | Influences structure |
| Deliverables | [Tangible/Intangible/Digital-enabled] | Affects value perception |
| Risk level | [Low/Medium/High/Digital-specific] | Higher risk = premium |
| Client relationship | [New/Existing/Strategic] | Influences discounting |
| Market rate | [Standard/Premium/Discounted] | Competitive position |
| **Digital component** | [None/Basic/Advanced/Next-gen] | Influences rates significantly |

### Pricing Model Options
| Model | Best For | Risk to Consultant | Risk to Client | Trend |
|-------|----------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| Time & Materials (T&M) | Undefined scope, evolving needs | Low | High | Declining preference |
| Fixed Fee | Clear scope, defined deliverables | High | Low | Common for standard work |
| Retainer | Ongoing relationship, undefined hours | Medium | Medium | Growing for AI partnerships |
| Value-Based | Measurable outcomes, clear ROI | Low | Medium | Preferred for AI/digital |
| **Outcome-Based** | AI implementations, digital transformation | Shared | Shared | **Emerging standard** |
| **Risk/Reward** | Performance-based, shared outcomes | Shared | Shared | Gaining traction |

### Digital Transformation Pricing
| Digital/AI Service Type | Typical Range | Model |
|------------------------|---------------|-------|
| Strategy & Assessment | $[XX]K - $[XX]K | Fixed fee |
| Implementation | $[XX]K - $[XX]K+ | Fixed or T&M |
| Ongoing Retainer | $[XX]K - $[XX]K/month | Retainer |
| Proof of Concept | $[XX]K - $[XX]K | Fixed fee |

### Recommended Model: [Model]
