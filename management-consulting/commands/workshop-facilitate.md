## Invocation

```
/workshop-facilitate [workshop objectives and session type]
```

If no objectives are provided, ask the user to describe the workshop purpose, participants, and desired outcomes.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define Workshop Design

Establish the workshop framework:

```
## Workshop Design

### Workshop Overview
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Title | [Workshop name] |
| Type | [Strategy / Design Sprint / Innovation / Planning / Retrospective] |
| Duration | [Half day / Full day / Multi-day] |
| Location | [In-person / Virtual / Hybrid] |
| Participants | [Number and roles] |
| **Async components** | [Pre-work / Post-work for hybrid] |
| **Time zones** | [For distributed teams] |

### Workshop Format Considerations
| Format | Best For | Technology Requirements |
|--------|----------|------------------------|
| In-person | Deep collaboration, building trust | Physical materials, room |
| Virtual-first | Global teams, speed, accessibility | Digital whiteboard, Video conferencing, Polling tools |
| **Hybrid (sync)** | Mixed location, real-time interaction | Dual-camera setup, hybrid board |
| **Async-first** | Reflection, global time zones | Digital collaboration tools, async video |

### Objectives
| Objective | Success Metric | Priority |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| [Objective 1] | [How we'll know it was achieved] | Must have |
| [Objective 2] | [How we'll know it was achieved] | Must have |
| [Objective 3] | [How we'll know it was achieved] | Nice to have |

### Outcomes
- [Specific deliverable 1]
- [Specific deliverable 2]
- [Specific deliverable 3]

### Participant Preparation
| Item | Owner | Due Date |
|------|-------|----------|
| Pre-read document | [Facilitator] | [Date] |
| Pre-workshop survey | [Facilitator] | [Date] |
| Data/inputs required | [Participants] | [Date] |
| **Tech check** | [All participants] | [Date - critical for virtual] |
```

### Step 2: Select Workshop Methodology

Choose the appropriate framework:

```
## Methodologies by Workshop Type

### 1. Design Thinking Workshop
Best for: User-centered innovation, new product concepts, service design

**Process**:
```
EMPATHIZE → DEFINE → IDEATE → PROTOTYPE → TEST
    │           │         │         │         │
 [User       [Point of   [Brain-    [Build    [Learn
  Research]  View]      storm]     It]       & Iterate]
```

**Enhancement**: Include digital ideation tools, co-creation platforms

### 2. Design Sprint
Best for: Fast decision-making, validating ideas quickly, team alignment

**Process**:
```
DAY 1: Map      DAY 2: Sketch   DAY 3: Decide  DAY 4: Prototype  DAY 5: Test
[Understand]  [Concept]       [Choose]      [Build]         [Validate]
```

**Enhancement**: Incorporate research, remote design sprint adaptations, digital prototypes

### 3. Strategy Offsite
Best for: Annual planning, strategic direction, competitive positioning

**Process**:
```
CONTEXT → ANALYSIS → OPTIONS → DECISION → COMMITMENT
  │          │          │          │           │
[Where    [Where     [Where    [Where     [How
 we are]   we are]    we can    we will]    we get there]
            (deep)    go]        (choose)
```

### 4. Innovation Workshop
Best for: Generating new ideas, breakthrough thinking, challenge assumptions

**Process**:
```
WARM-UP → FRAME → GENERATE → EVALUATE → PRIORITIZE → PLAN
   │         │         │          │           │         │
[Get      [Define   [Many      [Screen    [Select    [Next
 creative]  the      ideas]      ideas]     best]      actions]
            challenge
```

**Enhancement**: Enhanced brainstorming, scenario planning with digital twins

### 5. Retrospective (Agile)
Best for: Team improvement, lessons learned, process optimization

**Process**:
```
SET THE STAGE → GATHER DATA → GENERATE INSIGHTS → DECIDE ACTIONS → CLOSE
    │                  │                  │                │            │
[What              [What            [Why             [What         [Wrap up
 happened?]        happened?]       happened?]       should we     and
                                                      do next?]     commit]
```

**Enhancement**: Data-driven retrospectives with sprint metrics, async team input

### 6. Digital Transformation Workshop
Best for: AI adoption, digital strategy, technology roadmap planning

**Process**:
```
CURRENT STATE → OPPORTUNITY → SOLUTION → ROADMAP → VALUE CASE
     │              │             │          │           │
[Assess       [Identify      [Design     [Plan        [Calculate
 maturity]    use cases]     options]   timeline]    ROI]
```

#### Activity 1: [Activity Name]
**Purpose**: [Why this activity]

**Timing**: [Duration]

**Method**: [How it works]

**Inputs**: [What participants need to bring]

**Outputs**: [What we'll create]

**Facilitation Guide**:
```
Step 1: [Instructions] - [Time]
Step 2: [Instructions] - [Time]
Step 3: [Instructions] - [Time]

[Facilitator notes / common issues to watch for]
```

#### Activity 2: [Activity Name]
[Same structure]

### Materials Needed
| Item | Quantity | Owner |
|------|----------|-------|

| [Flip charts] | [4] | [Venue] |
| [Post-its] | [2 colors] | [Facilitator] |
| [Timer] | [1] | [Facilitator] |
```

### Step 4: Prepare Facilitation Materials

Create session guides and tools:

```
## Facilitation Toolkit

### Opening Script
```
"Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone. Welcome to [Workshop Name].

Today, we're here to [state the purpose]. By the end of our time together, we will have [deliverable].

A few ground rules:
- Be present and engaged
- Respect different perspectives
- Build on others' ideas
- Have fun with the process

Let's get started."
```

### Transition Scripts
```
Between activities: "Great work, everyone. Let's take a 5-minute break and then we'll move into [next activity]."

At midpoint: "We're about halfway through. So far we've accomplished [summary]. Let me tell you what comes next."

Near end: "We're entering the final phase. We have [X minutes] to [complete goal]."
```

### Closing Script
```
"Thank you all for your tremendous participation today.

Here's what we accomplished:
- [Outcome 1]
- [Outcome 2]
- [Outcome 3]

Next steps:
- [Action 1] - [Owner] - [Date]
- [Action 2] - [Owner] - [Date]

I'll send the workshop summary by [date]. Any questions?"

[End with clear action-oriented close]
```

### Decision-Making Frameworks
| Situation | Recommended Method |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Quick alignment | Thumbs up/down |
| Ranking options | Dot voting |
| Complex decisions | Multi-voting + discussion |
| Consensus needed | Gradients of agreement |
| Final authority | Decision rights matrix |

### Managing Dynamics
| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Dominant participant | "Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet." |
| Quiet group | Go around the room explicitly |
| Conflict | Acknowledge different views, find common ground |
| Off-topic | "Great point - let's capture that for later and stay focused on [topic]." |
| Time pressure | "We need to move forward - let's capture the detail in the appendix." |
```

## Notes

- Never skip the opening - it sets the tone for everything
- Timebox rigorously - workshops that run over lose energy
- Have backup activities ready in case you need to pivot
- Capture everything - nothing is too small to document
- Make sure someone is taking photos of whiteboards and sticky notes
- Build in breaks - creative thinking requires energy
- End on time - respecting participants' time builds trust
- Always have next steps with owners and dates
- Follow up within 24 hours while momentum is high
- Debrief the facilitation itself - continuous improvement
- For virtual workshops, test technology extensively beforehand
- Assign roles (facilitator, timekeeper, scribe) clearly
- Have fun - workshops should be energizing, not draining
- Use transcription tools for capture
- Incorporate async pre-work for deeper in-session collaboration
- Apply hybrid facilitation techniques for mixed audiences
- Use digital whiteboards as primary workspace
- Include wellness breaks for longer sessions
- Create persistent digital workspaces for post-workshop collaboration
