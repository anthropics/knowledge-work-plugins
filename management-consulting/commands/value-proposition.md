# /value-proposition -- Value Proposition Development

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Develop differentiated value propositions that resonate with target clients and articulate clear competitive advantage. Based on proven pursuit methodologies.

## Invocation

```
/value-proposition [client or market context] [offering type]
```

If parameters not provided, ask for:
- Client or market context
- Offering type (new service, existing repositioning, pursuit)
- Target audience
- Competitive differentiation known

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Client Context

Capture essential context:

```
## Value Proposition Context

### Client Situation
- Industry: [Industry]
- Current state: [Where they are]
- Desired state: [Where they want to be]
- Key challenge: [Primary pain point]

### Audience
- Primary decision makers: [Roles]
- Their priorities: [What matters to them]
- Their concerns: [What worries them]

### Competitive Landscape
- Current vendors/alternatives: [List]
- Known differentiators: [What others claim]
- Gap in market: [What's missing]
```

### Step 2: Apply Value Proposition Framework

Structure the value proposition using the **VALUE Framework**:

```
## Value Proposition: [Offering]

### Value Driver
**What value do we create?**
- [Primary value: cost reduction, revenue growth, risk mitigation, capability building]
- [Secondary value]

### Audience Link
**Why does this matter to THEM?**
- Connect value to their specific priorities
- Use their language and terminology

### Logic Proof
**Why should they believe us?**
- [Evidence 1: methodology]
- [Evidence 2: experience]
- [Evidence 3: credentials]

### Unique Differentiation
**What makes us different?**
- [Differentiator 1]
- [Differentiator 2]
- [Why it matters]
```

### Step 3: Test and Refine

Validate the value proposition:

```
## Validation Checklist

### Clarity Test
- [ ] Can someone explain it in 30 seconds?
- [ ] Is the benefit immediately clear?
- [ ] Does it avoid jargon?

### Relevance Test
- [ ] Does it address their specific pain?
- [ ] Is the timing relevant?
- [ ] Would they care?

### Differentiation Test
- [ ] Could a competitor make this claim?
- [ ] Is it specific, not generic?
- [ ] Do we have evidence?

### Belief Test
- [ ] Is it credible?
- [ ] Do we have proof points?
- [ ] Can we back it up?
```

## Output Format

Generate:

1. **Master Value Proposition** — One-paragraph version
2. **Elevator Pitch** — 30-second version
3. **Value Drivers** — Bulleted key benefits
4. **Proof Points** — Supporting evidence and examples
5. **Differentiation Statement** — Competitive positioning

After generating, ask:

> "Would you like me to:
> - Develop specific use cases for this value proposition?
> - Create messaging for different stakeholder levels?
> - Build a capabilities deck supporting this positioning?"

## Notes

- Strong value propositions focus on client outcomes, not your capabilities
- Test with real clients before committing to positioning
- Differentiation must be sustainable — avoid claims competitors can easily replicate
- Quantify value wherever possible — specific numbers beat vague promises
- Tailor messaging to the audience level (C-suite vs. functional leaders vs. practitioners)
- Revisit and refresh value propositions as markets evolve
- Proof points and case studies strengthen credibility
- Simplicity wins — if you can't explain it in one sentence, refine it
