# /value-proposition -- Value Proposition Development

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see [CONNECTORS.md](../CONNECTORS.md).

Develop differentiated value propositions that resonate with target clients and articulate clear competitive advantage. Based on proven pursuit methodologies.

## Invocation

```
/value-proposition [client or market context] [offering type]
```

If parameters not provided, ask for:
- Client or market context
- Offering type (new service, existing repositioning, pursuit)
- Target audience
- Competitive differentiation known

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Client Context

Capture essential context:

```
## Value Proposition Context

### Client Situation
- Industry: [Industry]
- Current state: [Where they are]
- Desired state: [Where they want to be]
- Key challenge: [Primary pain point]

### Audience
- Primary decision makers: [Roles]
- Their priorities: [What matters to them]
- Their concerns: [What worries them]

### Competitive Landscape
- Current vendors/alternatives: [List]
- Known differentiators: [What others claim]
- Gap in market: [What's missing]
```

### Step 2: Apply Value Proposition Framework

Structure the value proposition using the **VALUED Framework**:

```
## Value Proposition: [Offering]

### Value Driver
**What value do we create?**
- [Primary value: cost reduction, revenue growth, risk mitigation, capability building]
- [Secondary value]
- [Quantified impact: specific numbers, percentages, timeframes]

### Audience Link
**Why does this matter to THEM?**
- Connect value to their specific priorities
- Use their language and terminology
- Address their biggest fear or aspiration

### Logic Proof
**Why should they believe us?**
- [Evidence 1: methodology with track record]
- [Evidence 2: relevant experience with named outcomes]
- [Evidence 3: credentials, certifications, or third-party validation]

### Unique Differentiation
**What makes us different?**
- [Differentiator 1 — what only we can claim]
- [Differentiator 2 — why it's sustainable]
- [Why competitors cannot easily replicate this]

### Evidence & Execution
**How do we deliver and prove it?**
- [Delivery model: how the work gets done]
- [Track record: quantified results from similar engagements]
- [Risk mitigation: how we de-risk the engagement for the client]
```

### Step 3: Develop Messaging Hierarchy

Create layered messaging for different contexts and audiences:

```
## Messaging Hierarchy

### Headline Value Proposition
[One sentence: For [target client] who [need], our [offering] delivers [primary benefit] unlike [alternative] because [key differentiator].]

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
[3-4 sentences that a partner could deliver naturally in conversation:
- Hook: the client problem
- Solution: what we do differently
- Proof: one compelling result
- Action: what happens next]

### Stakeholder-Level Messages

#### C-Suite (Strategic)
- **Message**: [Focus on enterprise value, competitive advantage, shareholder impact]
- **Proof**: [Board-level metrics and outcomes]

#### Functional Leaders (Operational)
- **Message**: [Focus on capability improvement, team effectiveness, operational metrics]
- **Proof**: [Operational KPIs and efficiency gains]

#### Practitioners (Technical)
- **Message**: [Focus on methodology, tools, skill development, day-to-day improvement]
- **Proof**: [Practical examples and peer references]

### Competitive Positioning

| Dimension | Our Position | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| [Key dimension 1] | [Our stance] | [Their stance] | [Their stance] |
| [Key dimension 2] | [Our stance] | [Their stance] | [Their stance] |
| [Key dimension 3] | [Our stance] | [Their stance] | [Their stance] |

**Positioning statement**: In the [market category], we are the [differentiation] firm because [sustainable reason].
```

### Step 4: Test and Refine

Validate the value proposition:

```
## Validation Checklist

### Clarity Test
- [ ] Can someone explain it in 30 seconds?
- [ ] Is the benefit immediately clear?
- [ ] Does it avoid jargon?

### Relevance Test
- [ ] Does it address their specific pain?
- [ ] Is the timing relevant?
- [ ] Would they care?

### Differentiation Test
- [ ] Could a competitor make this claim?
- [ ] Is it specific, not generic?
- [ ] Do we have evidence?

### Belief Test
- [ ] Is it credible?
- [ ] Do we have proof points?
- [ ] Can we back it up?
```

### Iteration Guidance

For any checklist item that fails:
- **Clarity fails**: Simplify language, remove jargon, cut to one core benefit
- **Relevance fails**: Re-interview the client need — the value prop may be solving the wrong problem
- **Differentiation fails**: Dig deeper into methodology, team, or IP — generic claims need to be replaced with specifics only you can claim
- **Belief fails**: Add or strengthen proof points — quantified case studies, named references, third-party validation

## Output Format

Generate:

1. **Master Value Proposition** — One-paragraph version
2. **Elevator Pitch** — 30-second version
3. **Stakeholder Messages** — C-suite, functional leader, and practitioner versions
4. **Value Drivers** — Bulleted key benefits with quantification
5. **Proof Points** — Supporting evidence and examples
6. **Competitive Positioning** — Differentiation vs. alternatives
7. **Differentiation Statement** — One-sentence competitive positioning

After generating, ask:

> "Would you like me to:
> - Develop specific use cases for this value proposition?
> - Build a capabilities deck supporting this positioning?
> - Create a one-page leave-behind for client meetings?"

## Notes

- Strong value propositions focus on client outcomes, not your capabilities
- Test with real clients before committing to positioning
- Differentiation must be sustainable — avoid claims competitors can easily replicate
- Quantify value wherever possible — specific numbers beat vague promises
- Tailor messaging to the audience level (C-suite vs. functional leaders vs. practitioners)
- Revisit and refresh value propositions as markets evolve
- Proof points and case studies strengthen credibility
- Simplicity wins — if you can't explain it in one sentence, refine it
- Competitive positioning requires understanding what competitors actually claim, not just what they do
