Build a persuasive pitch deck for client presentations. Uses storytelling principles and pyramid structure to create compelling narratives that win engagements.

## Invocation

```
/pitch-deck [client name] [engagement type]
```

If parameters are not provided, ask for:
- Client name
- Engagement type and key messages
- Length preference (10 slides, 20 slides, etc.)
- Key differentiators to highlight

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Deck Objective

Clarify:

1. **Presentation context**
   - Audience (C-suite, board, working team)
   - Occasion (initial pitch, follow-up, final presentation)
   - Time available

2. **Key messages**
   - What do we want them to remember?
   - What action do we want them to take?

3. **Differentiation**
   - What makes us unique?
   - What evidence supports this?

### Step 2: Structure the Deck

A winning pitch deck follows a clear story arc:

```
## Standard Structure (15-20 slides)

2. Context and situation
3. The problem / opportunity
4. Why now?

### Our Solution (4-6 slides)
5. Our approach
6. Methodology
7. Key differentiators
8. What makes us unique

### Results & Credentials (3-4 slides)
9. Relevant case study 1
10. Relevant case study 2
11. Team experience

### The Deal (2-3 slides)
12. Scope and approach
13. Investment
14. Timeline

### Step 4: Apply Storytelling Principles

Following structured storytelling methodology:

1. **One message per slide** — Don't clutter — anchor every piece of content to your thesis
2. **Start with why** — Connect emotionally before logical — create urgency
3. **Use evidence** — Facts build credibility — quantify everything
4. **Create tension** — Problem → Solution → Result — build the narrative arc
5. **End with action** — Clear, specific next steps
6. **The storyline approach** — Ensure only the most relevant information is presented, avoiding unnecessary detours or tangents

## Output Format

Generate a complete pitch deck structure including:

1. Slide-by-slide content with titles and bullets
2. Visual suggestions for each slide
3. Speaker notes (optional)
4. Timing recommendations

After generating, ask:

> "Would you like me to:
> - Adjust the story flow?
> - Add specific case studies or credentials?
> - Create a shorter/longer version?
> - Develop speaker notes for presentation?"

## Notes

- Follow the "tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them" structure
- Every slide should support the overall thesis — if it doesn't advance the story, cut it
- Use visuals to illustrate, not walls of text — data visualization over tables
- Quantify results in case studies with specific metrics
- Make next steps crystal clear with specific timeline
- Keep slides to one key idea each
- Design for the audience — C-suite gets different treatment than working teams
- Embrace white space — clarity over density
- The "answer first" approach — lead with recommendations, support with analysis
