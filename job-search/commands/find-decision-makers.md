## What I Need From You

**Option 1: Company name + role**
Tell me the company and what role you're targeting. Example: "I'm applying for a Senior Frontend Engineer role at Stripe."

**Option 2: Job listing URL**
Paste the URL to the job posting. I'll extract the company, team, and role details.

**Option 3: General company research**
Just give me a company name and I'll map out the relevant people for your target function.

## Output

TODO: Define output format and workflow details.

## Tips

1. **Be specific about the role** — "Engineering Manager" is more useful than just "Stripe."
2. **Mention your function** — Helps me focus on the right part of the org.
3. **Share the job listing** — The more context, the better the results.
