## What I Need From You

**Who are you sending this to?** — Hiring manager name, recruiter, or just the company.

**What role?** — The position you're targeting.

**Any personal context?** — Why you're excited about this company, relevant experience, mutual connections.

---

## Output

TODO: Define output format and workflow details.

---

## Tips

1. **Keep it under 90 seconds** — The script targets a 60-90 second video.
2. **Be specific about the recipient** — A script for a hiring manager differs from one for a recruiter.
3. **Mention what makes you unique** — I'll weave it into the narrative.
